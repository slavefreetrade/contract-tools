## Build Setup

``` 
  npm install 

  node cli.js --help

```

## Sample Contract

```
  node greeter.js
```

Contract gets compiled, waits to be mined. This is a dev account, so we must send more transactions for it get mined into a block.

` node contract.js` will send some arbitrary transaction, run this in new terminal tab/window.

## Todo:
~~take contracts from [sebastians](https://github.com/slavefreetrade/SlaveFreeTrade/tree/master/dapp) dapp (files ending in .sol), script a similiar setup as the greeter where we compile the contract, deploy and listen. User greeter.js and lib/Greeter.coffee as reference.~~~

See the projects page for Slavefreetrade to follow next steps in roadmap.
